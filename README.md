**1. Single Responsibility Principle**
The SOLID Design Principles in C# help us solve most software design problems. These principles provide multiple ways to remove the tightly coupled code between the software components (between classes), making the software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. 

1. S - stands for the Single Responsibility Principle. This Principle states that each software module or class should have only one reason to change. In other words, each module or class should have only one responsibility.
2. O - stands for the Open-Closed Principle. The Open-Closed Principle states that software entities, such as modules, classes, functions, etc., should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. L - stands for the Liskov Substitution Principle. This Principle states that the object of a derived class should be able to replace an object of the base class without causing any errors in the system or modifying the behavior of the base class. That means the child class objects should be able to replace parent class objects without changing the correctness or behavior of the program.
4. I - stand for the Interface Segregation Principle. This Principle states that Clients should not be forced to implement any methods they donâ€™t use. Rather than one fat interface, numerous little interfaces are preferred based on groups of methods, with each interface serving one submodule.
5. D stands for Dependency Inversion Principle. This Principle states that high-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes. Both should depend upon abstractions. Secondly, abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
